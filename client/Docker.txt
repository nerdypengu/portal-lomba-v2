# Step 1: Use a Node.js 18 image to build the React app
FROM node:18 AS build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application files
COPY . .

# Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build
RUN ls -la /app/dist  # List build folder contents

# Step 2: Use a lightweight web server to serve the built files
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the React app build files to Nginx's HTML directory
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to access the application
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
